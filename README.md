This repository contains my work for ISYE 6501: Introduction to Analytics Modeling, a core course in the Georgia Tech MSA program. The course introduces key modeling techniques used in analytics, with an emphasis on applying mathematical and statistical methods to solve real-world decision problems.

Topics include linear regression, logistic regression, classification and decision trees, simulation, optimization, and time series forecasting.
